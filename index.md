## Team Organization

Charter
The project's goal is to develop a hands-free gadget that is straightforward to use and maintain, uses ecologically friendly designs and materials to produce a product, and may be expanded upon in the future for an end product. Along with creating a project we can add to our resumes for potential employers, the project team hopes to promote a positive work environment that encourages collaboration.

Mission Statement 
We believe that all people deserve access to reliable, easy-to-use, and comprehensible weather information. The goal of our product is to make that a reality for people who donâ€™t necessarily occupy one place. We use the most up-to-date technology to give our users the best experience possible. We use the latest sensors, actuators, and are always innovating to make our product better. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the world around us. We believe our product can keep people safe and make decisions about their lives while they are on the go.

## User Needs, Benchmarking, and Requirements
We identified our user needs by conducting research on products that are on the market. By combing through the pages of reveiws, five stars to one star, we were able to distill what the user was looking for in a mobile weather station. Our team specifically picked out smart rain gauges as a market to pursue and from what we gathered, the user needs were apparent. By going through the reviews of certain popular and unpopular smart rain gauges, we identified sore spots or highlights the consumer contiuously pointed out in their reviews. We took these pain points and praises, seperated out the fluff and kept what was relevent to us, dividing this data up into two categories, Latent and Explicit. Explicit being more easily identifiable pain points and Latent being points that are more difficult to pin down as to why they're frustrating. We then took these points of frustration and pain and turned them into specifcations from where our product can draw its strengths from.To ensure these specifications our design will revolve around we will constantly be reffering to our list of product requirements to make sure we incorporate at least the top twenty five percent of them in our product. Our product requirements list is our most purest form of user needs that relate specifically to our device and with this list we can asses our device according to it. For the full list of product requirements and user needs they can be found in the appendix.

## Design Ideation
Kalin Comins played the key role in the design process, his intial design concept is what sparked a host of different design ideas and iterations.
**Put your role in Generating ideas and then delete this comment** We used a couple of different brainstorming methods, mind mapping, figure storming, rapid ideation, but the method that worked best for us was round robin. Everyone was able to pitch their ideas and we voted on which would be the most viable for our group and the projects scope. We then took these ideas and ranked them with a 3 star sytsem, 1 being the least viable and 3 being the most viable. Then we all created a concept of our device around the ideas we ranked so we can have the most variety and originality as possible in our device. The concepts can be found in the appendix.**Add your concept to the appendix and delete this comment**
